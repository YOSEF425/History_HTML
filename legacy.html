    The State of Israel, officially established on May 14, 1948, is a democratic republic located in the Middle East, along the eastern Mediterranean coast. It shares borders with Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt, and includes disputed territories such as the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights.

Israel was founded as a homeland for the Jewish people following centuries of persecution, culminating in the Holocaust. The Zionist movement, which began in the late 19th century, sought to re-establish Jewish sovereignty in the ancestral land of Israel. The Balfour Declaration of 1917 and the UN Partition Plan of 1947 laid the groundwork for statehood, though the latter sparked immediate conflict with Arab nations and Palestinian communities.

Jerusalem is Israel’s proclaimed capital, though its status remains internationally disputed. Tel Aviv serves as the country’s economic and technological hub. Israel’s population exceeds 10 million, with Jews making up about 74%, Arabs around 21%, and others comprising the rest.

Israel is known for its advanced economy, particularly in technology, agriculture, and defense industries. It has a parliamentary system led by a Prime Minister, with laws enacted by the Knesset.

The country has faced ongoing conflict with Palestinians and neighboring Arab states. Despite peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, tensions persist, especially regarding settlements, borders, and refugee rights. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains one of the most complex and enduring geopolitical issues in modern history.

Israel also plays a significant role in global Jewish identity, serving as a cultural and spiritual center. Its history, achievements, and challenges continue to shape its evolving national narrative and international relations.
