    Theodor Herzl, often called the father of modern political Zionism, played a pivotal role in laying the ideological foundation for the State of Israel. Born in 1860 in Budapest, Herzl was a journalist, playwright, and visionary who witnessed rising antisemitism in Europe, particularly during the Dreyfus Affair in France. Convinced that Jews needed a sovereign homeland to escape persecution, he published Der Judenstaat ("The Jewish State") in 1896, proposing the establishment of a Jewish nation.

Herzl organized the First Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland, in 1897, where he famously declared, “At Basel I founded the Jewish State.” Though he died in 1904, long before Israel’s founding, his ideas galvanized a movement that would eventually lead to the creation of the state.

After decades of immigration, political lobbying, and struggle, the dream materialized on May 14, 1948, when David Ben-Gurion declared the independence of the State of Israel. Herzl’s vision became reality, and his legacy remains deeply embedded in Israeli society. His image appears in schools, currency, and public monuments, and his remains were reinterred on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem, a national site named in his honor.
